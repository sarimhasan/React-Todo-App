# A Modern Todo App

I made this app in order to learn the basics of React library for Javascript.

You can try this app [here](https://65dcad837b159708e14f9d6f--dazzling-jalebi-8691c3.netlify.app/)

## Features

- Add Todo
- Delete Todo
- Mark as Complete
- Current time

## Things I learnt

- Hooks
  - useState
  - useEffect
- Event Handling
- HAndling Arrays in React
- Tailwind Classes
- React Icons
- Saving data in Local Storage

## Things that I want to fix

### Local Storage:

Local Storage in this app does not remember your last action.

### Responsiveness:

This app is fairly responsible, but is not for small screens, because I was having some problems with the tailwind classes and did not had the time to finish it
